# Crypto Please Protocol

![Logo](HORIZONTAL-Black-Gold.png)

## A protocol to send crypto to all internet users.

Lets be honest, most people in the world don't care about the blockchain technology. Most people are already using applications like Venmo, Paypal or Revolut to exchange money or even invest into crypto. On the other side, we have crypto Wallets which gives access the new financial system but they are difficult to use most of the times and more important the onboarding is nonexistent.

That is until now, Crypto Please Protocol is the first easy, non custodial and secure protocol to send any kind of crypto to someone who knows literally nothing about crypto and doesn't have yet a crypto-address. Thanks to the Crypto Please Protocol, the sender can generate a 2 URL and he can share on any messaging system to someone. Then this user is incentivized to download the crypto wallet to get his money.

## Here comes the Crypto Please protocol
Crypto Please Protocol provides a protocol to generate payment links. Only a user who has access to the 2 payment links can widthdraw some crypto. These payments link are universal which means they can works accross different wallets. The protocol is non-custodial meaning during all the transfer, no third party are involved.
The Crypto Please Protocol enables to send SOL token, SPL token or any crypto-currency to a phone number or an email address via payment links. The protocol is:
- non custodial
- universal (works with all crypto) and no smart-contract involved.
- keeps full-privacy (zero information is leaking on the blockchain)
- can be implemented by any existing crypto-wallet (Trust Wallet, Coin98 etc..) to send payment links without any difficulty to increase their user-base

## How it works
We split the private key in two separate links. The first one is deep-link to make sure any user (registered or non-registered) can widthdraw their funds from the payment link. The application asks to click on the second link which is a custom-scheme link. The application recombine the two links and widthdraw the money.
